# 🚀 Scrcpy Smart Connect v2.0: Never Use USB Cables for Android Development Again

Are you tired of being tethered to your Android device during development? Let me introduce you to **Scrcpy Smart Connect** - a smart wireless connection manager that makes cable-free development a breeze.

## The Problem

As mobile developers, we constantly need to:
- Test apps on real devices
- Use hot reload during development
- Record screens for demos
- Debug issues that only happen on physical devices

But USB cables are:
- ❌ Restrictive
- ❌ Easy to forget
- ❌ Wear out over time
- ❌ Limit mobility

## The Solution

Scrcpy Smart Connect automatically manages wireless connections to your Android devices using scrcpy.

### Key Features

✅ **Auto-reconnect**: Remembers your device IP  
✅ **USB Fallback**: Seamlessly falls back if wireless fails  
✅ **Device Profiles**: Gaming, Recording, Demo, Battery Saver  
✅ **Multi-device**: Manage several devices easily  
✅ **Background Daemon**: Auto-reconnect on drops  
✅ **GUI Mode**: Optional graphical interface (v2.0!)  
✅ **Cross-platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows  

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/tareq-alomari/scrcpy-smart.git
cd scrcpy-smart
./install.sh

# Connect (first time with USB)
phone

# Disconnect USB - it's now wireless!
```

## How It Works

1. **First connection**: Plug in USB, run `phone`
2. **Script magic**: Detects device, gets IP, switches to wireless
3. **Future connections**: Just run `phone` - no USB needed!

## Device Profiles

Choose optimized settings for different use cases:

```bash
phone --profile gaming     # 120fps, low latency
phone --profile recording  # 1920p, high quality
phone --profile demo       # Borderless, always-on-top
phone --profile battery    # Low power consumption
```

## Multi-Device Management

Save and switch between devices:

```bash
phone --save work-phone
phone --save personal-phone
phone --save tablet

phone --device work-phone  # Quick switch!
```

## Background Daemon

Keep connection alive automatically:

```bash
phone --daemon   # Run in background
phone --status   # Check status
phone --stop     # Stop daemon
```

## GUI Mode (New in v2.0!)

For those who prefer graphical interfaces:

```bash
scrcpy-smart-gui
```

Features:
- Visual device selection
- Profile chooser
- Daemon control panel
- Settings editor
- Desktop integration

## Perfect For

- 📱 Flutter/React Native development
- 🧪 Mobile app testing
