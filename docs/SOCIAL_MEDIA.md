Hey r/androiddev! 👋

I built a smart wireless connection manager for scrcpy that makes connecting to Android devices via WiFi super easy.

**What it does:**
- Automatically remembers your device IP and connects wirelessly
- Falls back to USB if wireless fails
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Supports multiple devices
- One-line installer

**Perfect for:**
- Flutter/React Native development with hot reload
- Mobile app testing without cables
- Screen recording/streaming
- Remote device control

**Quick start:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareq-alomari/scrcpy-smart/main/install.sh | bash
phone  # That's it!
```

**Title:** [Tool] Wireless scrcpy connection for Flutter development - no more USB cables!

**Body:**

Hey Flutter devs! 👋

Tired of USB cables while developing? I made a tool that automatically connects scrcpy wirelessly.

**Why this is great for Flutter:**
- Hot reload works perfectly over WiFi
- No cable restrictions - move freely
- Optimized for 60 FPS
- One command to connect: `phone`
- Works on all platforms

**Installation:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareq-alomari/scrcpy-smart/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Usage:**
```bash
phone  # Connects automatically!
```

First time needs USB, then it's wireless forever (until you change WiFi).

Hope this helps your workflow! 🚀

# 🚀 Scrcpy Smart Connect: Never Use USB Cables for Android Development Again

Are you tired of being tethered to your Android device during development? Let me introduce you to **Scrcpy Smart Connect** - a smart wireless connection manager that makes cable-free development a breeze.

## The Problem

As mobile developers, we constantly need to:
- Test apps on real devices
- Use hot reload during development
- Record screens for demos
- Debug issues that only happen on physical devices

But USB cables are:
- ❌ Restrictive
- ❌ Easy to forget
- ❌ Wear out over time
- ❌ Limit mobility

## The Solution

Scrcpy Smart Connect automatically manages wireless connections to your Android devices using scrcpy.

### Key Features

✅ **Auto-reconnect**: Remembers your device IP
✅ **USB Fallback**: Seamlessly falls back if wireless fails
✅ **Cross-platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows
✅ **One-line install**: Get started in seconds
✅ **Multiple devices**: Manage several devices easily

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareq-alomari/scrcpy-smart/main/install.sh | bash

# Connect (first time with USB)
phone

# Disconnect USB - it's now wireless!
```

## How It Works

1. **First connection**: Plug in USB, run `phone`
2. **Script magic**: Detects device, gets IP, switches to wireless
3. **Future connections**: Just run `phone` - no USB needed!

## Perfect For

- 📱 Flutter/React Native development
- 🧪 Mobile app testing
- 🎥 Screen recording
- 🎮 Mobile gaming on PC
- 📊 Presentations

## Advanced Usage

```bash
phone --help      # Show all options
phone --list      # List all devices
phone --select    # Choose specific device
phone --reset     # Reset saved IP
```

## Performance Tuning

The script comes pre-configured for balanced performance (60 FPS, 1024p, 8M bitrate), but you can customize it:

```bash
# For weak WiFi
--max-size 720 --bit-rate 4M --max-fps 30

# For strong WiFi
--max-size 1920 --bit-rate 16M --max-fps 60
```

## Open Source

The project is MIT licensed and welcomes contributions!
