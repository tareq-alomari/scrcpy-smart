**Title:** [Open Source] Scrcpy Smart Connect v2.0 - Wireless connection manager with GUI

**Body:**
```markdown
Hey r/androiddev! 👋

I just released v2.0 of Scrcpy Smart Connect - a tool that makes wireless scrcpy connections effortless.

## What it does

Automatically manages wireless connections to Android devices via scrcpy with smart features:

- **Auto-reconnect**: Remembers device IP and reconnects automatically
- **Device Profiles**: Gaming (120fps), Recording (1920p), Demo, Battery Saver
- **Multi-device**: Save and switch between multiple devices
- **Background Daemon**: Auto-reconnect on WiFi drops
- **GUI Mode**: Optional graphical interface (new in v2.0!)
- **Cross-platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tareq-alomari/scrcpy-smart.git
cd scrcpy-smart
./install.sh
scrcpy-smart  # or 'phone' alias
```

## Why I built this

As a mobile developer, I was tired of:
- Plugging/unplugging USB cables
- Manually reconnecting after WiFi drops
- Remembering device IPs
- Switching between test devices

This tool solves all of that.

## Features

**CLI Mode:**
- One command to connect: `phone`
- Device profiles for different use cases
- Save multiple devices with nicknames
- Background daemon for always-on connections

**GUI Mode (v2.0):**
- Visual device selection
- Profile chooser
- Daemon control panel
- Settings editor
- Desktop integration

## Perfect for

- Flutter/React Native development
- Mobile app testing
- Screen recording
- Long development sessions
- Multiple device management
